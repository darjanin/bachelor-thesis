	Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language that is here for many years. It made great leaps through the time and today, with the third version, it brings a lot of new features. In spite of them, there is still place for improvement. This place fills CSS preprocessors like \href{http://sass-lang.com}{Sass} (http://sass-lang.com), \href{http://lesscss.org}{Less} (http://lesscss.org) or \href{http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/}{Stylus} (http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/). It is hard to say which of them is the best. Any of them can be helpful with your project and which one you choose is most of time on you. 

	In this thesis, I'm writing about the Sass. It is my choice, because of the community, relation with Ruby and my experiences with this language. It's recommended that reader of this tutorial is advanced in the CSS, while the CSS code in the examples will not be always explained. Most of time the knowledge of the CSS2 would be enough, except few sections that talks about Sass and the CSS3. In the second chapter I'm going to explain how works and what brings \href{http://compass-style.org/}{Compass framework} (http://compass-style.org/). It is one of the first frameworks for Sass and has great website reference. 

	The tutorial will at first explain how to prepare your workstation to work with Sass and than explain the syntax. It starts with the basics like variables and nesting. Moving to the more advance concepts as mixins, SassScript and directives. The example code is created for every explained situation. After that it moves to the Compass chapter. There it explains the basics about the command line tool for creating projects and the Compass core with it's mixins and functions.

	This tutorial was created with \href{http://sphinx-doc.org/}{Sphinx Documentation Generator} (http://sphinx-doc.org/). It helped creating the online version of this document, that can be found at the \href{http://vacuumapps.com/compass-sass-tutorial}{vacuumapps.com/compass-sass-tutorial} (http://vacuumapps.com/compass-sass-tutorial). The content in this work and on the site is the same, only the structure is changed. It does not explain everything what is possible in the Sass and Compass. The motivation is to provide fast way to start with Sass and find the reference for important parts of Sass in one place.
